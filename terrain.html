        <h1>Green Circle = Beginner Terrain</h1>

        <p>
            These areas are beginner slopes. You should come here once you try out bunny slopes which are areas completely dedicated to people who are first learning to ski.
            <br> Green Circle areas are marked with a specific sign. They are gently-sloped and groomed to make it easier for beginners.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="intermediate">
        <h1>Blue Square = Intermediate Terrain</h1>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Ski_trail_rating_symbol-blue_square.svg/1024px-Ski_trail_rating_symbol-blue_square.svg.png">
        <p>
            These areas are for skiiers who have slightly more experience but don't feel comfortable enough to move to slightly harder slopes. These slopes will be more steep and raw, but are still regualrly groomed. However, a skiier shouldn't expect unexpected cliffs or rocks on the slopes.
            <br> Blue Square areas are marked with a matching sign and sometimes a double blue square to indicate a bit more challenge. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="advanced">
        <h1>Black Diamond = Advanced Terrain</h1>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Ski_trail_rating_symbol-black_diamond.svg">
        <p>
           These areas are for advanced skiiers who are confident in their abilities or have been skiing a long time. These slopes are left slightly ungroomed and are much more scenic than easier terrains as they are natural. These slopes are also much less crowded. 
           <br> Black Diamond areas are marked with a clear sign, not to be confused with a double black diamond. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="expert">
        <h1>Double-Black Diamond = Expert Terrain</h1>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Ski_trail_rating_symbol-double_black_diamond.svg">
        <p>
            These areas are for expert skiiers because these areas have exposed boulders, sometimes cliffs, and can send skiiers into forced jumps. These terrains should only be used once fully comfortabke with easier terrains as they can cause injury. 
            <br> While these Double-Black Diamond areas are marked with multiple signs along with warning signs to caution skiiers. Some resorts have other terrains that are more challenging than these which should only be skiied with extreme caution.
